**Floodwaters turn into a holy river!**

(0s-3s)
Meet Sub-Inspector Chandradeep Nishad, a UP cop who's making waves on the internet!

(4s-6s)
He's standing **waist-deep in water** inside his flooded home in Prayagraj, but instead of panic, he's offering **flowers and prayers**!

(7s-10s)
"Jai Ganga Maiya ki! Main dhann hogya maa, aap mere darwaaze pe dastak dene aayi" (Hail Mother Ganga! I am blessed, Mother, that you came knocking at my door)

(11s-14s)
**37 million views** and counting! His video shows him performing a puja in his submerged living room.

(15s-18s)
But here's the crazy part... Nishad says he was once a **national-level swimmer**!

(19s-22s)
He's now turning his flooded street into a stage, swimming, diving, and even **leaping into the water from the roof** with friends!

(23s-26s)
Not everyone's impressed, though. Critics say, "Don't add to pollution! Clear the river pathways, stop dumping waste-water..."

(27s-30s)
Plot twist: some users are joking, "Ganga ma home delivery kar rahi hai paap dhone ke liye" (Ganga's delivering sins for free!)

(31s-34s)
So, what do you think? Is Nishad's enthusiasm **inspiring** or **irresponsible**?

(35s-60s)
