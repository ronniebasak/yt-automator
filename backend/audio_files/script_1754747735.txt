Here's a 60-second YouTube Shorts script based on the article:

**(0s-5s)**
**Floodwaters turn into a holy ritual!** Meet UP cop Chandradeep Nishad, who's taking the internet by storm with his unusual response to Prayagraj's floods.

**(5s-10s)**
He's waist-deep in water, inside his own home, offering flowers and prayers... saying "Jai Ganga Maiya ki! You came knocking at my door, Mother!"

**(10s-15s)**
**But here's the crazy part...** Nishad, a sub-inspector, was once a national-level swimmer. And he's making the most of the floodwaters.

**(15s-25s)**
He's swimming in the waterlogged lanes, diving from his first-floor window... and even leaping into the water with friends from the roof!

**(25s-35s)**
**But not everyone's impressed.** Critics say, "Don't add to the pollution!" and "Respect holy rivers by keeping them clean!"

**(35s-45s)**
The internet is divided... with some praising his spirit and others raising valid concerns.

**(45s-55s)**
**Plot twist:** Nishad's video has been viewed nearly 37 million times! Is he a hero or just adding to the problem?

**(55s-60s)**
So, what do you think? Should we take a cue from Nishad and find the divine in chaos... or prioritize cleaning up our rivers? Let us know in the comments!
